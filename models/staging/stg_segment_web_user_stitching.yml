    description: "This model performs 'user stitching' on top of web event data. User stitching is the process of tying all events associated with a cookie to the same user_id, and solves a common problem in event analytics that users are only identified part way through their activity stream. This model returns a single user_id for every anonymous_id, and is later joined in to build a `blended_user_id` field, that acts as the primary user identifier for all sessions."
    columns:
      - name: anonymous_id
