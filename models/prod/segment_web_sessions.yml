  - name: segment_web_sessions
    description: "The purpose of this model is to expose a single web session, derived from Segment web events. Sessions are the most common way that analysis of web visitor behavior is conducted, and although Segment doesn't natively output session data, this model uses standard logic to create sessions out of page view events.

    A session is meant to represent a single instance of web activity where a user is actively browsing a website. In this case, we are demarcating sessions by 30 minute windows of inactivity: if there is 30 minutes of inactivity between two page views, the second page view begins a new session. Additionally, page views across different devices will always be tied to different sessions.

    The logic implemented in this particular model is responsible for incrementally calculating a user's session number; the core sessionization logic is done in upstream models."

      - name: utm_medium
        description: 'how the traffic is coming to your site? Is it through email, a display ad, an online forum? This ensures our downstream analysis can easily see which channel performs the best. Examples: “email”, “paid-display”, “paid-social”, “organic-social”'
